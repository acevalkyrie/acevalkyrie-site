                <h2>Designing Since 2015</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Levi Zelley, a freelance web developer who's been designing and creating web pages since July
                    of 2015. Over the years I have completed dozens of commissions and web projects to cater to specific
                    users' needs, or to showcase personal work. I've also supplemented this experience with college-level
                    graphic design courses.
                </p>

                <h3>Primary Areas of Expertise</h3>

                <p>
                    I work well with flexbox and grid, allowing for seamless and responsive layouts, and I have a particular
                    fondness for making creative but uncluttered sidebars and headers to convey necessary information.
                    CSS has become intimately familiar to me, and I am very well-practiced at keeping up with clients'
                    evolving needs throughout a site's development. Form and function are equally important in my web
                    designs.
                </p>

                    alt="A graphic of a laptop, displaying a website created by AceValkyrie Web Pages (quirkwise.acva.dev). This is a fan site allowing users to rank their favorite characters from the manga My Hero Academia. In keeping with the theme, the website displays a color scheme of black, red, and blue, with accents of yellow, to utilize colors associated with the property. It also uses a bold title of a similar font to the manga's title, and a comic font in a large point size for legibility."

                <p>
                    I also excel at establishing a coherent color scheme for a given website, as well as working with a
                    clients' preferred color scheme in a way that will remain accessible and aesthetically pleasing.

                <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated with a 3.7 GPA in Mott Community College's Information Technology degree, completing
                    web development courses related to programming (Python, JavaScript, PHP, C#, and C++), databases, and
                    working both virtually and physically with various operating systems. I have limited experience in
                    working on the back-end of websites, but a solid enough foundation to research from.
                    <!-- with a focus
                    on web development. I am approximately 44% done with my degree, having completed courses that explored
                    basic CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to supplement my existing knowledge, as well as courses on Python, C#,
                    C++, PHP, databases, various operating systems, and networking to help with backend development.
                    Future courses will focus on cybersecurity, end-user support, and further knowledge of .NET
                    programming. -->
                </p>
                <h3>Direct Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Classes involved hosting databases with MySQL workbench and interfacing with those databases using
                    PHP. Sanitizing inputs and security features like salting and hashing were also taught in this class.
                    I used WinSCP to manage front-end, but I have also taken classes on networking and operating systems
                    that taught me how to operate command line interfaces of different operating systems, as well as
                    how to send commands to remotely hosted servers.
                </p>

                >
                <p>
                    In my personal projects, I have stuck to using DigitalOcean, which allows me to host and manage
                    servers for websites I create.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of my web commission experience is in creating custom blogs to help clients
                            showcase content. I can confidently create a unique and exciting website to advertise or
                            provide information, but if you are looking for an advanced site with safe e-commerce features
                            or users and passwords, you probably want to hire an entire team, not an individual developer
                            like myself.
                        </p>

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; If you're still interested in a website made by me, you can contact me through
                            any of the methods found on this site, and I'll try to get back to you quickly to let you
                            know if I think I can be of help.

                            I'm Levi Zelley, and I got my start designing completely custom pages for my blogs in 2015
                            to impress all my friends. I fell in love with HTML and CSS almost immediately, and I've
                            been finding excuses to make any kind of web page I could ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love trying new things and learning new things, and I'm always looking for the best and most
                            fun way to create a website for any purpose. Left to my own devices, I mostly design web apps,
                            simple tools hosted online, and rudimentary browser games.
                        </p>

                </div>

                        <p>
                            Some of my personal favorite projects are the character sorting/ranking web apps and the
                            editable bingo boards I made to help streamers engage their viewers when watching a popular
                            fanmade movie.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've also made a wide variety of blogs, review and recommendation pages, navigation pages,
                            simple calculator pages, and more. Hopefully there will be many, many more projects to come!
